Welcome to the hypersonic pretty-damn-quick modelling library! 

Originally, the abbreviation of HPM comes from the honours programme, master's degree, but I thought I could give it a new meaning now that I am done with that.
For now, only the version for a single stagnation point is uploaded (the other will be added in the coming weeks, I am still working on some better interfaces for that). 


The program can be run from the shell with any python compiler, but the matplotlib might not function properly if e.g. run from the terminal.
For proper functioning with matplotlib, it is best to run the program from anaconda/ spyder/ etc., so that the results can be displayed well.

The HPM_main is a simple import code, but by importing of the modules, they are being executed. 

Keep in mind that there are still likely many mistakes and errors/ insufficient error handles in the code.
If you spot something that can be improved (which is not that hard), feel free to send me a suggestion or a question regarding it.

Please also keep in mind that sometimes function names might be misleading, as originally they were inteded to do something else.
Then, they might have been rewritten to do something more fitting for their placement in the code.
If the name of the function does not seem to correspond to its definition/ outputs, please first check how it is implemented before reporting a mistake.
In time, I will try to fix all such misnamings. 


Some modules are included in module groups to simplify the import processes. The hierarchy is below:

HPM mathematics:
	- HPM_vector_mathematics
	- HPM_matrix_mathematics
	- HPM_get_integrate
	- HPM_project_from3Dto2D

HPM_stagnation:
	- HPM_find_stagnation
	- HPM_calculate_stagnation
	- HPM_calculate_stagnation_heating
	- HPM_assign_stagnation

HPM_numerics:
	- HPM_separate_centroids
	- HPM_determine_dt
	- HPM_find_velocities
	- HPM_vertex_values
	- HPM_surfvel_fit
	- HPM_backtracing_numerics

HPM_viscous:
	- HPM_solve_viscous_thermodynamics 
	- HPM_solve_eckert

HPM_transform_mesh:
	- HPM_transform_mesh_alpha
	- HPM_transform_mesh_beta
	- HPM_transform_mesh_scale

The general modules and module settings (e.g. for displaying of matplotlib) are in HPM_import.
