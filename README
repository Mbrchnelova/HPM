Welcome to the hypersonic pretty-damn-quick modelling library! 
Originally, HPM comes from the honours programme, master abbreviation, but I thought I could give it a new meaning now that I am done with that.
For now, only the version for a single stagnation point is uploaded (the other will be added in the coming weeks, I am still working on some better interfaces for that). 


The program can be run from the shell with any python compiler, but the matplotlib might not function properly.
For functioning with matplotlib, it is best to run the program from anaconda/ spyder/ etc., so that the results can be displayed well.

The HPM_main is a simple import code, but by importing of the modules, they are being executed. 




Some modules are included in module groups to simplify the import processes. The hierarchy is below:

HPM mathematics:
	- HPM_vector_mathematics
	- HPM_matrix_mathematics
	- HPM_get_integrate
	- HPM_project_from3Dto2D

HPM_stagnation:
	- HPM_find_stagnation
	- HPM_calculate_stagnation
	- HPM_calculate_stagnation_heating
	- HPM_assign_stagnation

HPM_numerics:
	- HPM_separate_centroids
	- HPM_determine_dt
	- HPM_find_velocities
	- HPM_vertex_values
	- HPM_surfvel_fit
	- HPM_backtracing_numerics

HPM_viscous:
	- HPM_solve_viscous_thermodynamics 
	- HPM_solve_eckert

HPM_transform_mesh:
	- HPM_transform_mesh_alpha
	- HPM_transform_mesh_beta
	- HPM_transform_mesh_scale

The general modules and module settings (e.g. for displaying of matplotlib) are in HPM_import.
